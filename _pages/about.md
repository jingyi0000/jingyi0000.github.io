I am a Ph.D. student at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), under the supervision of [Prof. Lu Shijian](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/shijian.lu/index.htm). My research interests include computer vision and unsupervised learning. 

Before my Ph.D. study, I received my B.Sc. degree in electronic information science and technology from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and M.Sc. degree in signal processing from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU).
